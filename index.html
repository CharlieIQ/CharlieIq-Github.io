         A png is a format used for simple images, logos, or for transparent images. 
         A Jpeg is used for more complex and larger images, and has more colors available. It's mainly used for photographs.
         A Gif is used for animations and has a smaller color wheel. It's used for sending animated messages, and animating small videos.
